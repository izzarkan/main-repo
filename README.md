# main-repo

This is where I will be putting my "small" projects alongside my portfolio

## Log 1 - 20 April 2025

Added calculator project version 1, will be updated later

## Log 2 - 21 April 2025

### MAJOR CHANGES

Made the landing (main) site better. But it still needs some improvements. ~~(Mobile responsiveness is still quite bad...)~~ **Fixed now. (As of 21 Apr 25, 21:21)**

#### Sub-log 1

Added social links, added more mobile responsiveness. Might add Gallery if I'm not lazy. Tidied up the web, and not the source code. It's a mess.

## Log 3 - 27 May 2025

Just simply updated the HTML. Yes, Gallery is SCRAPPED.

## Log 4 - 29 May 2025

Simply tweaked it out juuuust a little...

- **"Quirky"** title
- FavICON, YES
- Added Twitter/X Link
- Fixed alignment
- Removed Gallery

## Log 5 - 30 September 2025

I simply disabled the projects, why? I'm going to make a separate repository for my projects. Although the Anchor Tag is still there.

## Log 6 - 1 October 2025

Archived this repo, since I'm making a new one.

That's all, thanks.
